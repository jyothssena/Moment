    "interpretation": "Classic Gothic ending: protagonist dies, but curse continues. \"So we beat on\"—we're all under the same spell. \"Borne back ceaselessly\" is eternal return, Gothic repetition. Gatsby became ghost trying to retrieve ghost of his past. Now we're all ghosts too, haunting our own lives, dragged backward by invisible forces. The \"vast obscurity\" is Gothic darkness that consumes everyone eventually. Fitzgerald ending with collective haunting: American Dream is the ghost story we're all living in. Beautiful, terrible, inescapable.",
