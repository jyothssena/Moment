He did\nnot know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the\ncity, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us\nthen, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine\nmorning----\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.",
