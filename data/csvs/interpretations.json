Her voice doesn't contain money metaphorically; it functions AS\nmoney within the symbolic economy of desire. The inexhaustible charm is crucial. Unlike commodities\nthat deplete through use, Daisy's value perpetually regenerates because it's not tied to labor. It's\ninherited, therefore infinite. The white palace invokes Hegelian master-slave dialectic. She's the master\nwho doesn't labor, entombed in structure that requires others' work to maintain. Golden girl completes\nthe reification. She's been transformed from subject into object, from person into precious metal.\nGatsby's attempting to overcome alienation through acquisition. He believes possessing her will heal\nhis class wounds. But possession doesn't transform the possessor. He can own the golden girl but can't\nbecome golden himself. His voice will always betray his origins. Material conditions produce\nconsciousness, and his consciousness was produced by scarcity hers by abundance. They speak\ndifferent languages fundamentally.\n(Word count: 209)",

No character growth. Just recognition that human effort is perpetually defeated by\nforces beyond individual control.
