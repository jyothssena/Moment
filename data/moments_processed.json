Gatsby embodies that paradox. The trembling is somatic manifestation of psychic disturbance. His body betrays what his isolation attempts to conceal.

What's interesting: Fitzgerald says it was \"full of money\" all along, that's what made it inexhaustible, created the \"jingle\" and \"cymbals.\" So the charm ISN'T the money, the money CAUSES the charm. Money as input generating specific output (charm). The \"king's daughter, the golden girl\" metaphor: fairy tale logic applied to class. Money doesn't just change what you can buy, it changes how you sound. Your voice becomes data that encodes wealth.",

Confidence, ease, lack of worry--all audible. The inexhaustible charm derives from inexhaustible resources. What appears as personal quality is actually systemic advantage. The palace imagery spatializes class structure: she occupies elevated position, literally inaccessible to those below. \"King's daughter\" indicates inherited, not earned, status.
