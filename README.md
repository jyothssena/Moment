MOMENT is a private (Reading + journaling + Connection) platform where users read books, capture meaningful passages as visual "moments," and write personal reflections. AI analyzes these interpretations using multi-modal machine learning to identify thinking patterns, themes, and emotional responses. The platform then quietly surfaces intellectually compatible users, allowing people to find their community through authentic reflection—not performative posting—while maintaining full control over privacy and connection choices. 

Procedure on how to run the application will be added
