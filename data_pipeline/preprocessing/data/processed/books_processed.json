With an anxiety that almost\namounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless\nthing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my\ncandle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the\ncreature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs. How can I describe my emotions at this\ncatastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His\nlimbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!---Great God! His yellow skin\nscarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of\na pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed\nalmost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight\nblack lips.",

As he went\non I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which\nformed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought,\none conception, one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein---more, far more, will I\nachieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the\nworld the deepest mysteries of creation. I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a state of\ninsurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it. By degrees, after the\nmorning's dawn, sleep came. I awoke, and my yesternight's thoughts were as a dream.",

But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected,\nwhen, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried manner he immediately began\nan enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with cold\ncivility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\nsaid not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began: 'In\nvain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I\nadmire and love you.' He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was\nnot more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of its being a\ndegradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a\nwarmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.",

'I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or\nthe words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.'

Now be sincere; did you admire me\nfor my impertinence?' 'For the liveliness of your mind, I did.' 'You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very\nlittle less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with the\nwomen who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone.
